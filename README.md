# My Library

This Project is part of The Odin Project's Curriculum

- [Live Here](https://jpalvadev.github.io/library/)

## Things I learned - getting better at

- Local Storage.

- Handling problems with element position on mobile, specially problems that arise with fixed elements and the search bar.

- Classes. This project is separated in 3 classes, UI, Data, and the App main class.
  Hoping one day I will get back to this project and apply an MVC approach.

- Async / Await.

- Working with APIs

## Description and considerations

- A simple bookshelf.
- You can search by author, title, ISBN, etc. Search is done thanks to the Google Books API.
- Once a book is found, I try to find a better cover image using the OpenLibrary API, if it's not found, it shows de one with low res from Google.
- It uses Local Storage, so data is not loss when the page reloads.
- It's responsive. It looks good on mobile, well, at least on my phone :)
